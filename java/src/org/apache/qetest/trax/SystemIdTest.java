/**
 * Test behavior of various types of systemId forms.  
 * <b>Note:</b> This test is directory-dependent, so if there are 
 * any fails, check the code to see what the test file is expecting 
 * the path/directory/etc. to be.
 * I'm also using RFC1738 as the definition of what various 
 * systemId's should look like: the validation of this test is 
 * a little tricky, since it's not necessarily clear exactly which 
 * forms of file: always have to be supported by the application.
 * (Or which forms of file: are supported by the underlying parser) 
 * Also, we really need to write some platform-dependent tests 
 * for this area, to account for 'c:\foo' type paths in Windows, 
 * and for '/usr/bin' type paths in UNIX-land, as well as various 
 * links and such (although that may be beyond the scope of what 
 * Xalan and it's parser do, and more into testing the JDK itself).
 *
 * Note RFC1738 specifies that file: URL's always use 
 *  forward slash / as a file separator
 * ABSOLUTE-PATHS
 * file:///e:/path/file.txt absolute path to e:/path/file.txt
 *
 * file://localhost/e:/path/file.txt path to e:/path/file.txt 
 *  on localhost, but goes direct to filesystem
 *
 * file://otherhost/e:/path/file.txt absolute path to
 *  otherhost, but RFC1738 doesn't actually specify the 
 *  protocol to use to get to the other machine to actually 
 *  get the file
 *
 * RELATIVE-PATHS
 * file:e:/path/file.txt is theoretically a relative URL
 *  w/r/t the current Base URL
 *
 * file:/e:/path/file.txt is theoretically a relative URL
 *  that starts with /e:/... - not likely to be useful
 *
 * file://file.txt theoretically a hostname (not a filename)
 *  with no path or file portion
 *
 * ILLEGAL-PATHS
 * file://e:\path\file.txt is illegal, since RFC1738
 *  specifically says / forward slashes
