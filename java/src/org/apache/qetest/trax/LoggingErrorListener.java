     * automatically call checkPass when we see an item that matches, 
     * or to call checkFail when we get an unexpected item.
     * Generally, we only call check* methods when:

     * <li>containsString is not set, reset, or is ITEM_DONT_CARE, 
     * we do nothing (i.e. never call check* for this item)</li>

     * of any particular event; all events after that one will 
     * be treated as ITEM_DONT_CARE.  Callers can of course call 
     * setExpected again, of course, but this covers the case where 
     * we handle multiple events in a single block, perhaps out of 
     * the caller's direct control.

     * validate the event as above, and then we potentially 
     * re-throw the exception as by setThrowWhen().
