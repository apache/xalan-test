/**
 * Helper interface to wrapper various XSLT processors for testing.
 *
 * A TransformWrapper wraps a particular 'flavor' of XSLT processing. 
 * This includes both a particular XSLT implementation, such as 
 * Xalan or Saxon, as well as a particular method to perform 
 * processing, like using streams or DOMs to perform transforms.
 *
 * As an important side effect, this class should return timing 
 * information about the steps done to perform the transformation.
 * Note that exactly what is timed and how it's timed should be 
 * clearly documented in implementing classes!
 * 
 * This is not a general-purpose wrapper for doing XSLT 
 * transformations: for that, you might as well use the real 
 * javax.xml.transform package itself.  However this does allow 
 * many conformance and performance tests to run comparatively 
 * between different flavors of processors.
 *
 * TransformWrapper is a bit of an awkward name, but I wanted to 
 * keep it separate from the pre-existing ProcessorWrapper that 
 * this replaces so we can ensure stability for Xalan testing 
 * while updating to this new class.
