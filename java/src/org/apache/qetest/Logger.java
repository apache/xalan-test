/**
 * Interface defining a utility that can log out test results.
 * This interface defnines a standalone utility that can be used
 * to report the results of a test.  It would commonly be used by a
 * testing utility library to produce actual output from the run
 * of a test file.
 * <p>The Logger defines a minimal interface for expressing the result
 * of a test in a generic manner.  Different Loggers can be written
 * to both express the results in different places (on a live console,
 * in a persistent file, over a network) and in different formats -
 * perhaps an XMLTestLogger would express the results in an
 * XML file or object.</p>
 * <p>In many cases, tests will actually call a Reporter, which
 * acts as a composite for Logger objects, and includes numerous
 * useful utility and convenience methods.</p>
 * <ul>Loggers explicitly have a restricted set of logging calls for
 * two main reasons:
 * <li>To help keep tests structured</li>
 * <li>To make it easier to generate 'reports' based on test output
 * (i.e. number of tests passed/failed, graphs of results, etc.)</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>While there are a number of very good general purpose logging 
 * utilities out there, I prefer to use this Logger or a similar 
 * class to report the results of tests because this class 
 * specifically constrains the format and manner that a test reports 
 * results.  This should help to keep tests more structured and 
 * easier for other users to understand.  Specific Logger 
 * implementations may of course choose to store or log out their 
 * results in any manner they like; in fact I plan on implementing 
 * a <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/index.html">
 * Log4JLogger</a> class in the future.</p>

     * For example, if you <code>setLoggingLevel(ERRORMSG)</code>
     * (currently found in the {@link Reporter Reporter} subclass) then INFOMSGs
     * will not be reported, presumably speeding execution time and saving

     * <li>CRITICALMSG - Must-be-printed messages; may print only selected
     * fails (and skip printing most passes).</li>
     * <li>ERRORMSG - Logs an error and (optionally) a fail.</li>
     * <li>FAILSONLY - Skips logging out most pass messages (still
     * reports testFileResults) but prints out all fails.</li>
     * <li>WARNINGMSG - Used for non-fail warnings - the test will
     * continue, hopefully sucessfully.</li>
     * <li>STATUSMSG - Reports on basic status of the test, when you

     * analysis tools later on against the results and screen 
     * against loggingLevel then as well.</p>
     * <p>A common technique is to run a set of tests with a very 
     * high loggingLevel, so most or all output is stored by Loggers, 
     * and then analyze the results with a low logging level.  If
