/**
 * Interface defining a utility that can log out test results.
 * This interface defnines a standalone utility that can be used
 * to report the results of a test.  It would commonly be used by a
 * testing utility library to produce actual output from the run
 * of a test file.
 * <p>The Logger defines a minimal interface for expressing the result
 * of a test in a generic manner.  Different Loggers can be written
 * to both express the results in different places (on a live console,
 * in a persistent file, over a network) and in different formats -
 * perhaps an XMLTestLogger would express the results in an
 * XML file or object.</p>
 * <p>In many cases, tests will actually call a Reporter, which
 * acts as a composite for Logger objects, and includes numerous
 * useful utility and convenience methods.</p>
 * <ul>Loggers explicitly have a restricted set of logging calls for
 * two main reasons:
 * <li>To help keep tests structured</li>
 * <li>To make it easier to generate 'reports' based on test output
 * (i.e. number of tests passed/failed, graphs of results, etc.)</li>
 * </ul>
 * @author Shane_Curcuru@lotus.com
 * @version $Id$
 * @todo maybe add set/getOutput methods? Would allow most
 * types of loggers to get output streams, etc. externally
