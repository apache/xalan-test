Bugzilla1009: Malformed attribute expression lacks line/column information

bevan.arps@clear.net.nz (Bevan Arps)

jkesselm May2023: NO LONGER TRUE:

[xalantest] file:///home/keshlam/git/xalan-test/tests/bugzilla/Bugzilla1009.xsl; Line #13; Column #24; Attr Template, Attribute: ref has an illegal value: {foo(bar)

Should be closed as resolved. We *could* turn this into a regression
test with a Java testlet, but I don't think that's especially worth
doing since if it arises again it'll probably be with a different
error message.

  <xsl:template match="doc">
    <out>
	<!-- Below line causes error due to unclosed '{', but:
		 error is not helpful either on cmd line or programmatically -->
	<link ref="{foo(bar)"></link>
    </out>
