Note that this directory behaves a bit differently from most other test dirs.

First, it can contain a mix of Java-based and direct stylesheet
tests. That's nice, and we should probably permit it in more of the
test directories.

Second, for the stylesheet tests, the reference output kept here and
called ".out" rather than residing in a separate -gold directory (or
even being named .gold).This is a historical artifact from
development of the test framework, and at this point is much more
confusing than helpful... especially since it may create confusion
when bug-report tests are moved into the main test suite (as they
should be when fixed).

At some point we really should reconcile the test drivers for consistency.
